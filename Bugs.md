2. close The pop-up infoWindow will automatically exit the running program, which is not expected
3. close the main window will not close the infoWindow,and the program still runs
4. when the pop-up info window shows up, I can still use the main window to look up dates, when it shouldnâ€™t, the pop-up window should have the priority, and the main window should be blocked at this time.
