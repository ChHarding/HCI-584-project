##Appointment Booking System Desktop App

###Target User:
Doctor’s office staff as target user and primary stakeholder
Patients as secondary stakeholder

###Task Description:
Designing an appointment booking system for doctor’s offices and patients. With the app, patients can check out available date and time on the app, and request a booking/removal/change through email. The staff in the doctor's office will review the booking requests and perform the booking on the app and update the bookings. 

###Workflow and User interaction:
- Set a range of dates and blocks of time (on weekdays, 1 hour blocks 9am to 5pm).
- Share the dates and time blocks with patients via app (patient portal). 
- Both patients and the doctor's office can see what's already booked.
- Patients can request a booking (or removal or change), and the doctor’s office gets notified and performs the actual booking.
- Lock the booking time block when someone requests/proposes a booking.
- Customers get email confirmation when their booking is confirmed by the staff.
- Both sides can request to get notification some time before the start time.
- Possible external mechanisms to be used:
    1. Email sending and receiving API
    2. GUI design package,such as PyQt or Tkinter

###GUI:
Desktop app, with differentiated features for patient and doctor’s office portal.
